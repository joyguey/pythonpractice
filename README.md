# Python Practice
This notebook is meant to track my attempt at doing something productive during the covid-19 quarrantine by learning python. I will be following the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) which was found in my Humble Bundle purchase. However you can read it online for free thanks to the author Al Sweigart.
